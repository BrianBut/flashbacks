<p>Sparrow size, heavily streaked, heavy slightly crossed bill. It has an inconspicuous yellow wash on the primaries. The facial pattern is a good match for the streaky seed-eater. They were in a flock of about 60 birds which include brown backed seed-eaters.</p>
<p>The beak is a bit slender, and the face pattern wrong, and the voice wrong for non breeding bishops.</p>
<p>About 60 of these birds arrived on 22nd January in the garden and nearby buildings, announcing themselves by canary like twittering. Because of this, and the pink, slightly crossed, bill I am classifying them as Northern Grossbeak-Canary. The facial pattern and plumage is unlike any in 'Birds of Africa', but I speculate they are in eclipse or transition plumage.</p>
