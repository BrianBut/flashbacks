When we were into the third week of coronavirus lockdown experts were reporting that the lockdown for those over 70 could last for a year. I wouldn't survive that without becoming depressed. 

This site is part of my self prescribed therapy. My idea was to write down a pleasant memory every day and put them on the web so it would be possible for others to read them. The very fact that others can see what I am writing makes me feel less isolated. My years in Africa reinforced my notion that my history and memories are a major part of me. And if other people remember me then, in a way, I will live on after death.

After the fourth memory it was apparent that many my good memories often had a sting in the tail. e.g the unjustness of the Bantustans, of the abducted child soldiers of the Chimerenga war, or the loss of all the big tuskers from Murchison Park, or the hostility of a few Muslem clergy. So now I think I will recount any memories, good or bad. It will still do me good. But perhaps not yet for the most painful ones.

If any of my family or friends want to write down their own reminiscences. I will happily help them publish their stories on a site like this.
