Unmistakable and splendid. A pair were over the lake on 1st February 2009. These photographs were taken on the next occasion I saw them on 21st April 2010. On this occasion the mate of the bird pictured was perched in a Eucalyptus tree about 100m. away.

In the first photograph the eagle is being harassed by a Yellow-Billed Kite
