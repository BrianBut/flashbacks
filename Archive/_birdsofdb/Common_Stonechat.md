This pair were indulging in pursuit courtship on a farm at an altitude of about 3000m. At  least I think it was courtship. The female is similar to a winchat, but perhaps larger. The striking black and white <em>albicensis</em> male is quite unlike other common stonechat males.

There is some doubt whether this is a species or a family of Saxilla Torquatus.
