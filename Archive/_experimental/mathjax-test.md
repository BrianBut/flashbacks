Note there are two ways of opening and closing equations

When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

Note the use of \alpha for greek symbols
\\(\alpha\\)

Fractions are denoted by
\\(\frac{1}{2}\\)

Subscripts by \\(H_1\\)

Multicharacter subsripts by \\(H_{max}\\)

\\(H_{max} - H_{min}\\)

\\( \frac{H_{max} - H_{min}}{H_{max}} \\)

\\( \huge{\frac{1}{2}}\\)

\\( \large{\frac{T_H - T_C}{T_H}} \\)

\\( \eta_{max} = \large{\frac{T_H - T_C}{T_H}} \\)

\\( \dot{x} \\)
