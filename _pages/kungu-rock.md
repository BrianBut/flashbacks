I was never a good rock climber although I enjoyed trying. 

Kungu rock is a 120 foot sheer sided rock among the green banana plantations of Uganda. This vertical inselburg has a cleft down the middle. It was possible to chimney up the cleft, feet on one side, and back on the other.

From the top there was a fine view of the lush green banana plantations typical of Buganda in the 1960's. On the top there was a shallow depression in the rock, containing a scattering of coins and other mysterious small objects. Clearly offerings. I did not touch.

There were old East African coins; one and five cent coins with a hole in the middle. Anna and half anna coins were from India. None were modern currency. To an adjacent hollow I added a couple of current East African coins for whichever deity lived there.

We never started physical activity in the heat of the day, and the sun was getting close to the horizon while we were going down. At the bottom we came out of the gloom of the crack to meet a Muganda man dressed in a white robe.

He was surprised to see us coming out of the gloom of the rock. Insofar as a dark skinned Muganda can blanch, he blanched. Smiling we shook hands in greeting. He scampered on up the chimney.

I had never before been taken for a god. I have since discovered that many steep sided inselbergs in Africa have a dish of small coins on the top.
