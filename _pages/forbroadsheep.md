(*maximum of 200 words before 23rd May*)

I believe myself too literal to do casual conversation. I hear “How are you?” and I think “How am a what?” and I am lost for an answer. I have been reluctant to talk about myself as I fear I will not be believed.

But as a slightly deaf over-seventy in the lockdown I fear isolation. I wonder if I will ever be able to resume my already limited social life. 

My solution is to talk to myself; Well not actually talk but write; and I’ve but it online so others can see it; Well they could see it but I haven’t informed the Google search engine so they are unlikely to find it.

My target is an average of 300 words a day with a different topic each day in a manner interesting to other people. I was feeling down when I started so my rule was ‘Happy Memories’.  But the happy memories reminded me of related less happy memories. So I now include unhappy  or disturbing memories. I think I may want to extended it further to include essays or explainers.

My website now works in a limited sort of a way. I am filling much of the rest of my time writing an improved website capable of hosting others who feel an urge to do a similar sort of thing.
