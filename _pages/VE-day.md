My first memory is of a bonfire, a lot of excited people together and fireworks. It was on the green behind our house in the camp in Didcot. 'Donkey Bray' was there in his flapping greatcoat and showing of his collection of fireworks in his poachers pocket. My mother said it would have to have been V-Day. 
Today is the 75th anniversary of VE day. I am in my 76th year so I would have been 18 months old. I am unlikely to have remembered VE day. I am told there were smaller celebrations on VJ- day. Could I have memories of this?
