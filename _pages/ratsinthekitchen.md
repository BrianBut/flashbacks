Carol is one of the most easy going people I know. Sent by the Dutch VSO to Fort Hare as a mathematics lecturer she was accomodated in a very big old bungalow used as a guest house by the University. The old bungalow was one of the few buildings on campus accessible by wheelchair. So this is where the university sent professor Philp Morisson and his wife Phyllis. 

Carol did not get on with Phyllis. Phyllis expected Phil to recieve VIP treatment. Dr. Morrison was a MIT professor who had taken a leading role in developing and fusing the first nuclear weapons, had taken a leading role in the search for extra terrestrial stars, was still researching neutrinos from deep space, and who wrote a regular column for 'Scientific American'. 

At Fort Hare Phyllis and Carol were expected to share a kitchen. A worn old kitchen with ancient rectalinear sinks, scrubbed wooden table and draining board and a bottled gas stove. They had been provided with some basic provisions.

Carol, and partner Dave were well established in the guest house. After the Morrisons first night Phyliss came to the common dining room a declared 'There are rats in the kitchen!'. "Yes", agreed Carol, "Cane rats". Its got to be cleaned out. Said Phylis. "Why said Carol, we leave them alone and they leave us alone". 

That day Phyllis got four university workers to clean out the kitchen, bathroom and round about.

"Its a lot nicer", said Carol a couple of days later, "and the rats seem to agree".

Dave and Carol did not come to Phil's first lecture. Phyllis and Carol never really got on.
