Two allegedly corrupt politicians. The president of the United States, Donald Trump, confronted Cyril Ramaphosa with "evidence" that South African white farmers were being forced out of South Africa. The evidence consisted of pages from social media. 

One of these pages showed a roadside with white crosses along it. 

When I saw it, my gut clenched. I was taken back to the year 1961 when, with my then girlfriend, I saw the film in the Forum Cinema in Bath. There was the memorable scene of the crucified slaves lining the road to Rome.

Why did I react so strongly to that picture?

That night I remembered: -- Colenso (or somewhere near), it was there I had seen the crosses pictured in Trump's 'evidence'. To me they come over as more a temple to hatred, than a shrine to rememberance. The Boers hate the British, or those of British descent. Those of British descent mistrust the Boers. In this part of the world most Zulus seem to hate both.

Colenso, Spion Kop (Spyon Kopje), Ladysmith: the names and dates inscribed on the dusty regimental colours which hung above the pupils at school services in Bath Abbey. Those colours were removed before I left school. Those places are near here in this part of Kwa Zulu Natal. Here we still remember. The Zulus remember the loss of their land and cattle.

South Africa had, and still has very high levels of murder and violent crime. 

En route to the area we visited Durban for the first and last time; staying overnight in a hotel. There was more gunfire than in Mafikeng, but less than in Alice. In the morning it became obvious the the hotel was also a brothel. Feeling uncomfortable we drove north to walk the Drakensburg trails. The landscape and flora are a relief.

The two of us expected a three day walk, but, fortunately, as things turned out, carried enough food for a week as we thought we might be delayed by flash flooding of the streams we had to cross. 

The walk started with a steady climb crossing and recrossing a stream, but then in the afternoon came a thunderstorm. We sheltered under a rock outcrop. The rain stopped. The stream had risen so that it had become difficult to cross. We crossed it in light rain. The rain continued, so on a hidden away patch of level ground we erected our tent, made a meal, and stayed in the tent for the rain to stop. 

The rain did not stop for two whole days. On the third day we were able to continue walking in the light rain. 

That night we were able to camp higher up the mountainside. All night there was an animal or animals snuffling and moving around outside our tent. We did not open the tent door. Wild boor, warthog, porcupine, jackal, eland or other buck? -- the imagination worked overtime. In the morning when I went out I found porcupine quills. I'm glad I didn't open the tent door and get some of those quills in my face.

Onthe fourth day. We took advantage of some of the many of the rock shelters we came across. 

Those rock shelters were remarkable because so many of them contain Bushman art. You enter a rock cave or crawl under a rock shelter which looks entirely devoid of anything but rock. But then when your eyes have adapted the animals, and sometimes men appear. The buck are wonderfully clear and adapted.

It is a shame that so many of these paintings have been damaged by wood smoke from wood fires in the shelters.

We have been told that it was in this area the last of the Drakensburg bushman was shot as vermin in the early 20th century. He was carrying pigments and painting sticks.
