We were new to Namasagali college, and as had yet to get our house fully organised. Father Grimes had invited us to dinner in his house. After I stayed for a game of chess.

While we were playing a young man arrived. He looked nervous, or even scared. Father Grimes introduced us; "Luwum", he said "He was head boy. His father is Anglican Archbishop of Uganda. "Not any more" said Luwum. "He's dead - I'm going to Kenya - Can I stay here tonight?". "All right, go to the kitchen and see if John can give you something to eat. Come back and sit here until I finish this chess game."

Father Grimes was delighted to win the chess game. "What happened?" he asked Luwum. "They had a car crash on the road to Jinja". "They?". "Three of them: - he was with Mr Oryema and someone else. They were supposed to be going to Entebbe". 

Father Grimes grimaced. "How did you find out?". "They sent some men to tell us". "Police or Security?". "Maybe police; They took us to see the body". "Did you see him?". "He was covered with a blanket. We saw his face but they wouldn't let us see any more". They are taking his body back to Gulu. We aren't going to the funeral.

There is something seriously wrong if any Ugandan does not go to his fathers funeral.

"Have you seen Oryema?". I was later to learn Vincent Oryema was a 6th former and school prefect whose father was a Ugandan Cabinet Minister. "No, I haven't spoken to anyone but you". "I'll speak Vincent after study. I'll tell him to keep it to himself until we get confirmation the body is identified".

Luwum left for Kenya before dawn.

*I have just looked up Arcbishop Luwum on Wikipedia. This account varies in some respects, but what I have written is what I remember.*

*I have today learned Archbishop Luwum's statue is now on Westminster Abbey among the 20th Century Martyrs.*
