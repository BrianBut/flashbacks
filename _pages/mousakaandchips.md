The University of Surrey was once Battersea College of Advanced Technology, located in Battersea Park Road. The first shop to the the left of the College facing the road, was a record shop. Alf's cafe was a few doors along. I and some of my friends preferred to have lunch here.

The mousaka and chips was the chief lure, with a cup of tea. With this for lunch you were comfortably set up for the day. A plate full of freshly cooked chips with mousaka spreading all across the top. It makes my mouth water to this day.

When complemented on the quality of the food he would claim, with a grin that 'the vegetables 'fell off the back of a lorry'.
